# About

Hi there, my name is Kai Evans

## Random facts

Before my child was born, I have red roughly 300 books within 5 years. Mostly
non-fiction, business, strategy, history, and such. My biggest year was 91
books. They had counted a 5 volume edition of WWII history that year, and I'm
still a bit sensitive about it.

I learned how to surf at the age 34 through books and youtube videos. I surfed
non stop for almost 7 years after that. I'm still fascinated by the sport. The
beach is my happy place.

I'm an amateur luthier. I've been around guitars since 8th grade, and I have
build 9 of them so far. I started with electrics, but gradually shifted towards
high end still string acoustic ones. I can talk about guitars for hours.
