Which is a great idea, but it comes at a cost of extra configuration DSL that you need to learn and manage. And also you won’t be able to do anything else with your hosts either. And that’s why didn’t really include it on the list.  Because all four flavours will run on basically any linux distribution of your choice, and Talos doesn’t particularly fit into that equation.
