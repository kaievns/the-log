title: Performance vs. behaviour

One of the key responsibilities of any manager is to manage performance of their
direct reports. Which, despite of being a seemingly obvious concept, is a
surprisingly murky subject that many managers struggle with, often through their
entire careers.

Often, the reason for this is that management is something people just picked up
from the peers, rather than something they necessarily studied. And today, I'm
hoping to fill in some blanks and help you navigate the subject with more
understanding.

## A brief history of management

We don't have a whole lot of written accounts of management practices prior to
the industrial revolution, but it is probably acceptable to assume that it
basically involved a lot of punching people into faces until they do as they
told.

During the early industrial revolution the society got sharply divided onto
those who owned the means of production and those who didn't. And with that the
working class was born.
