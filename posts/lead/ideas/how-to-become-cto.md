Throughout my career in engineering management, the one question that engineers keep consistently asking in interviews and first 1-on-1s is this: "How did you become a CTO?". Today, I'm hoping to unwrap this question a little bit.

The weird thing about the CTO _title_ is that it is probably one of the most poorly defined roles in the industry. There is a huge difference between a startup CTO, a growth company CTO, and an enterprise level organisation CTO. Hence, we need to do some structuring before we can answer the question of how to become a CTO.

## What does a CTO do?

Generally speaking, there are three aspects to a CTO role, regardless of the scale of an organisation.

1. a technical expert
2. an executive
3. a strategist
