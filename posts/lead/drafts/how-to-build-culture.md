title: How to build a good culture
---

There is no shortage of talk about building a good culture in organisations
those days. And if you have red my article about the
[inner workings of a culture](/posts/we0V4) -- yes, a shameless plug -- you know
I have a rather specific view on the subject.

And so, today, I wanted to step away from generalisms and talk more specifics:
how to actually build a decent culture. And yes, it doesn't have to involve
buying a ping-pong table and hanging the company values posters in the office.

## What are the rules

As I said in my previous article, I'm not a huge fan of values based culture
creation. Because it's not specific enough for the actual goal we're trying to
achieve. And so, instead I will talk about it in terms of creating a good solid
environment conducive to creative work, such as software engineering.

My main problem with values driven environments is that they tend to mostly
contain and proliferate the founders values rather than the group's needs and
wants. It's great if the founders know what they're doing and can set good norms
for their peers rather for their own comfort. But, more often than not, that's
not the case and it's "my way or the highway", all the way to the IPO.

Instead, I want to talk about the fundamentals; about building a great working
environment with strong peers cohesion from scratch. How it works and what's
important.

If you are interested in this topic, you have most likely heard terms such as
"psychological safety", "blameless culture", and so on. They are not wrong, but,
there is a superstructure that includes all those great points.

There are most likely more than one way to look at it, but there is a framework
that had stuck with me throughout the years. It defines the requirements for a
person's safe and productive attachment to a peer group and it includes the
following three fundamental questions:

1. Do I belong here?
2. Do we have a future together?
3. Am I safe?

As a leader, you need to forgo your own comfort and focus on those three.

## Culture and belongingness

Belongingness is the foundation of any strongly cohesive group dynamic. It is
the sense of belongingness that generates the unconditional trust that all high
performing teams require to operate successfully; especially if a decent amount
of stress involved.

Belongingness is a double edged tool though. The easiest way to cultivate a
sense of belongingness is to run an exclusive club. If all the members are
essentially the same, then the sense of belongingness comes by default. The
problem with exclusive cubs though is that they don't scale and they don fare
well when they face change.

We don't have to walk far to see examples of that. The history of open-source is
littered with the white middle-class dude communities. They all struggle to
expand beyond those circles even when they try really hard to be open and
inclusive. Because, if an new member is not like the 90% of a homogeneous group,
they won't feel like they belong there, no matter what the group say.

And that brings us to the main point. We call this a _sense_ of belonging
because it is intuitive and non-verbal. Words don't really matter much here, and
a person needs to _feel_ like they belong to a group, not to rationalise it.

The problem here is that belongingness grows out of one's _identity_. If a
person can bring their whole self into a group and drop the barriers, and hence
become a productive member of a peer group, then they can say that they belong
there. If on the other hand, their identity is not acknowledged or considered
inferior the identities of the rest of the group, then this person is bound to
struggle regardless of anyone's best efforts and intentions.

There is a way out of this mess, and it's called **diversity**. An identity of a
group can be purposefully crafted around the idea of diversity as the unifying
factor. If a group is purposefully non-homogeneous, and differences are prised,
then it is bringing the unique self into the group that turns into the bonding
factor. Being different brings value.

It is a surprisingly difficult feat to pull off, though. Basically because in
any diverse environment there is usually a dominant group that will _allow_ for
the diversity to exist for as long as their own status at the top of the food
chain is not challenged.

And that brings us to the most difficult idea to stomach. If we want to build a
culture that scales and evolves long term, we need to build a culture around
diversity. And the only way to build a diversity based culture is to build a
diverse leadership team. And the only way to build a high functioning and
diverse leadership team is when the big boss is not a member of the dominant
group.

Look, I didn't say it will be easy. Nothing worth doing is easy.

## The future that binds us

In my humble opinion, the dumbest thing any leader can do is to threaten firing
people if they won't do what they are told. Another one in the same category
would be going into redundancies and expect that those who remains would feel
grateful to still have a job. Here is another one, hire a whole lot of
contractors to get to the market faster.

What do you think all of those decisions have in common and why they are
detrimental to creating a good robust culture? It's one thing, those decisions
either threaten or don't assume continuity in a relationship.

Continuity is another critical ingredient in any healthy culture. Because if
there is no future, or the future is highly uncertain, then why bother? Why
bother going extra mile, why bother to be helpful, why even bother staying with
the group? Time is universally in a limited supply for everyone, and no-one in
their right mind will invest their most precious assent into something that has
no future.

Even the most loyal to the company and it's mission will mentally check out and
play it safe if their future with the company is threatened.
