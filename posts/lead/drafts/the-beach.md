When we look at software engineering companies throughout the years, we can see
patterns of interconnection between engineering and other functions. Bulk of the
companies still treat engineering as a cost centre; an internal agency of sort.
But, the industry is getting smarter, in many companies engineering gets
integrated into cross-functional profit centers through autonomy and enablement
practices.

But, I believe that the role of technology in a software development
organisation goes further than mere cost vs. profit centre conversation. In the
most disruptive organisations technology itself is elevated to the state of
fundamental truth. That is how you build google maps, iphone, oculus rift, and
ChatGPT.

I have this little metaphor that I like to tell to demonstrate the point.

## The beach

Imagine a person walking a dog down a beach. The white noise of the surf, a
gentle breeze. The person is lost a bit in their thoughts as they are trotting
along. The dog is snooping back and fourth across the curved lip of the sand.

The dog makes semi-random moves across the beach, and the person slowly follows
it. If you look at their foot prints along the beach, it looks like a set of
real-life data sampling smoothed with an exponentially moving average.

You can think of this image as a miniature representation of a software
engineering company.

The hound is the marketing and sales department. They interact with the market
non stop. There are tonnes of interesting and exciting things happening in the
market all the time. New customers, new competitors, new opportunities. And they
love chasing them all!

The person represents the product team. A person is dragged along by the dog.
But the person doesn't repeat the dog's footsteps exactly. A person analyses
what the dog finds and tries to makes sense out it. They enjoy each other
company but, in the end, it is the person who holds the leash and decides where
they're going.

The beach represents the engineering, or rather the technology itself. In the
end of the day, this little story--a person walks out a dog at the beach--the
path they take is defined by the curved shape of the beach. That is the
_context_ of this story; it defines what's possible.

The point of this story is that the role of technology in any technology
organisation goes beyond the mere cost vs. profit rhetoric. Because it is
technology that defines what is possible in this story. And that it is pushing
the technological limits that enables companies to play out their stories to
their full potential.

I'm not trying to diminish the value of business development efforts here. That
is still critical work that any aspiring software engineering company must
execute flawlessly. "Programming is the easy part", as we like to joke. But it
is all too often that companies undercut their own potential by treating
technology as a commodity rather than trying to push its limits.

## What is possible

In the age when SaaS products are literally designed for fast migration off
competition, customer loyalty is a feeble thing. Building products with off the
shelf parts and then pray that you won't have copycats with better margins is
just not a very smart idea. The offering differentiation must go through and
through, including the technology. And the edge needs to be carefully maintained
over time.

Even in the b2b context where a vendor migration is a long and painful process,
those multi-year contracts are normally signed with the expectation that a
vendor will maintain their superiority long term.

And in that, the most sustainable strategical foundations of any software
engineering company is to innovate relentlessly ahead of the competition. It's a
classical red queen problem, a successful company has to innovate non-stop just
to stay where they are.

Systems thinking postulates that any complex system's behaviour is a result of
it's internal structure. The beach, the person, and the dog is the internal
structure of any modern agile software development organisation; they all play
in roughly the same field in that aspect. And it is this internal structure that
produces the behaviour we see, and, ultimately, separates successful companies
from those that perish way too soon.

So, don't just follow the dog blindly, explore the beach: the winds, the swell,
and all the point breaks. Your future as a company depends on it.
