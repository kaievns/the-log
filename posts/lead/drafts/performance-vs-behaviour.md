One of the key responsibilities of any manager is to manage performance of their
direct reports. Which, despite of being a seemingly obvious concept, is a
surprisingly murky subject that many managers struggle with. Often through their
entire careers.

I have a rather contrarian view on this subject when it comes to creative
professionals like software engineers. And today I'm trying to outline the
point.

## The price chart

I'll start with a bit of a diversion. Look at the picture below, it's a random
slice of the NASDAQ price chart.

<!-- ![NASDAQ price chart](./images/price-chart.png) -->

Do you see the ups and downs, right? So, just buy low and sell high. Leverage
yourself to the tits and you'll get rich in no time. Money grow on trees, easy
peasy lemon squeezy, right? Well yes, except roughly 95% of rather smart people
who try that fail. Price charts look obvious in retrospect, but really hard to
predict ahead of time.

The EU actually has a law that requires brokers to disclose their account
liquidation numbers. And on average, of people who try trading financial markets
for a living, 70-80% blow up their accounts within few months.

The point I'm making is that markets are _really_, _really_, and I mean _really_
unpredictable. And that's markets in their pure form, just money moving around.
What does it tell you about more complex situations like a startup trying to
find a market fit for their products?

That's right 95% of them will fail. Not because they're run by idiots, but
because pleasing the market is a surprisingly tough gig. And anyone who tells
you that they had the right idea from the beginning and it all worked out, are
either a fool, or a liar. Or they are trying to sell you consultancy services.

## Creative bottom line

At the end of the day, what matters in any organisation is the bottom line; if
that doesn't move there is no organisation, pure and simple. And when we start
talking about organisational performance, team performance, or an individual
performance, what we really want to see is their effect on the bottom line.
That's why we hire people in the first place.

This is particularly true for the creative class workers. Because it is their
creative output that has the most impact on the organisational performance.
Engineers, product designers, marketers. Those are the people who create the
bulk of business value out of thin air.

Here is the problem though. If the markets are inherently unpredictable, then
how you can attach quantifiable KPIs to creative work that supposed to deliver
bottom line effect in those markets? Well, you really can't. Because there is no
telling what the market will do ahead of time.

And what's the next best thing? That's right, define those KPIs as a reflection
of how well a person "executes" on the Key Crew vision.

But then again, if 95% of very smart people fail at trading pure price action in
financial markets, then what does it say about the Key Crew ability to predict
the market fit with their vision? And so we're back to the same problem again,
trying to measure the bottom line effect from innately unpredictable creative
effort.

Success in a creative field comes from having an edge that tilts probabilities
of success in one's favour. That edge comes from experience and knowing what a
person is doing. An edge is not a guarantee though, it just allows one to stack
up their wins and losses so that would result in a net profit long term.

## Performance management

The roots of the type of performance measurements that we're trying to use on
members of the creative class are going all the way back to the factory floors.
That's where they started to measure worker's performance and assign KPIs to
their output.

Unfortunately, that is not how creative efforts work. Creative work doesn't pay
by the hour, it pays per a good market fit idea. And for every good idea there
are usually a dozen of not so great ones. Produced by exactly the same people.

And I'm talking about pure product work here, not taking into the consideration
all other organisational, logistic, compliance, and financial complexities
attached to pretty much any creative endeavour in a technology company those
days.

It's just not a very smart idea.

There is one good use for KPIs based performance management in any creative
industry though, and that is to drive people out. If you really want to get rid
of a person, just put them on a performance improvement plan with objective KPIs
attached, and they will resign themselves after the first check in.

If you like your people and really want to retain them, then maybe consider
doing the opposite of what makes people leave.

## The behavioural model

Fortunately, there is another way to look at this problem. And that is to use a
behavioural model. There are a few frameworks to choose from, but they all boil
to the same point.

Seniority of a person in any field is defined by their experience. Roughly
speaking seniority represents the amount of complexity a person can be _trusted_
to deal with. Those past experiences define the person's _behaviour_, or
attitude towards the problems they are working on.

Here is a very simple model from adult responsibilities development theory:

- `dependant` - a person cannot take on tasks without a supervision
- `independent` - a person can perform most tasks by themselves
- `inter-dependent` - a person can lead/coach others

Each level is defined via a person's behaviour which results in the types of
tasks they can be trusted to reliably handle. There are other more elaborate
models like that.

The point of this approach is that it is the _behaviour_ of a person that
dictates the outcomes, rather than skill and knowledge. And that is a very true
idea in creative professions, especially in this day and age when knowledge has
become a commodity.

And if you subscribe to the idea that it is the _behaviour_ that drives the
outcomes in a creative field, then it follows that performance management should
focus on those behaviours rather than the bottom line figures and outcomes.

## Real life examples

Let me give you a few examples that are closer to the real life situations. It
is still a rather simplified model, but you can expand from there to your own
situation.

Let's say we have a super simple developer career ladder that looks like so:

- `junior developer` - corresponds to the **dependant**
- `senior engineer` - corresponds to the **independent**
- `technical lead` - corresponds to the **inter-dependent**

I have purposefully kept it simple so I could link their expected _behaviours_
to the responsibilities development model I have mentioned above. And so the
model works like so:

- a junior developer supposed to learn and ask a lot of questions,they are not
  supposed to commit production work unsupervised
- a senior developer supposed to be able to solve most technical problems
  unassisted
- a technical lead supposed to navigate technical decisions and coach people

Now lets look at a few situations where _behaviours_ of those engineers don't
fit the expectations based on their seniority:

- A senior engineer requires constant input and corrections to their work. Which
  means they cannot commit production work independently. Their _behaviour_
  matches the junior developer rather than a senior one
- A tech lead throws their weight around, breaks away the team and takes on
  technical tasks independently. Their _behaviour_ reflects the **independent**
  senior engineer role rather a technical lead one
- A junior developer takes tasks and completes them with satisfactory quality on
  their own. They can tackle the bulk of technical challenges by themselves. In
  this instance they _behave_ like an **independent** senior engineer.
- A senior engineer helps their team members to compare pros and cons of a
  technical decision, gives their opinion, and actively tries to elevate other
  members in terms of their skill and knowledge. This person is focused on the
  team **inter-dependencies** and _behave_ like a tech lead

Again this is a rather simplistic structure just to demonstrate the point. But,
I hope you get an idea of how it hinges together, and how it could be expanded
to encompass the entire engineering department with all the necessary seniority
levels.

Also, I hope you have noticed the complete absence of the bottom line outcomes
in this model, such as lines of code delivered, timelines, dollar figures, etc.
That is because we are managing the _behaviours_ that lead to the outcomes,
rather than the outcomes themselves.

## Continuous performance management

And now we've came to the past part of this system: the actual people
management.

One of the biggest drawdowns of a factory style management system with objective
bottom line KPIs and annual performance reviews is the disconnect between what a
person does and what their performance review says. It's bad enough that in
creative industry a person's effort doesn't always reflects in the market
results. But, giving a person "quantifiable" feedback months later when they
can't even remember the details of what they did is exceptionally counter
productive to their growth and development.

In behavioural systems that approach just doesn't work. Behavioural feedback, in
order to be effective, needs to be immediate. That is especially critical when a
person is in the process of transitioning between seniority levels and not
entirely confident yet about expectations for their new role.

And in that light, the behaviour based management systems focus on what's known
as the continuous performance management. Those normally manifest as weekly
1-on-1s and regular coaching sessions. The idea is that rather than wait for
annual or quarterly reviews, a person gets immediate feedback--both positive and
negative-- for their behaviour. Expectations are constantly reiterated and gaps
are addressed before they develop into actual problems.

This approach allows the people to reach their optimal performance levels and
become productive as quickly as possible. Which, in turn, leads the positive
outcomes as soon as the circumstances will allow.

My personal favourite part of continuous behaviour based performance management
is that one doesn't need to wait for quarterly or annual numbers to arrive to
justify a person's promotion. As soon as a person can demonstrate behaviour
consistent with their next level, and they have skill/knowledge for it, they can
be safely promoted. This allows a company to elevate their overall seniority
levels very quickly, which inevitably has a positive impact on the bottom line
deliverables. Because the more skilled people are, the better the chances that
they will produce something market worthy.

## A word of caution

Admittedly, it's not all butterflies and rainbows in the behavioural land. This
is by far the best performance management approach that I know of in terms of
outcomes, but implementation tends to face some challenges. I'll mention two of
those here.

Depending on the state of HR and regulatory compliance pressures, you might face
some pushback implementing such systems. You'll get lectured about setting SMART
goals, KPIs and all of that. Worst come to worst, you can always squeeze your
behavioural based system into objective looking KPIs. Do all the required annual
performance paperwork, but then exercise continuous performance management
practices on the daily basis. HR doesn't really need to know about those. It's
extra pain, but can be workable for the greater good.

Second one is people challenges. People are all different, but generally
speaking we could say that there are two groups structured and organic. People
who prefer to interact organically tend to have no problem with those
behavioural systems. The structured ones on the other hand might need a bit
more, well, structuring. For those people you can take your creative license
rather far and wrap the behavioural patterns into SMART goals.

Whatever you do, keep this in mind. Make sure that behaviours are defined
clearly and consistently. And, don't succumb to the pressure of defining
performance in terms of output. If you do, sooner or later you will regret your
life choices.
