title: Why your burn down chart looks like a cliff

Overtime, while working in management, everyone picks up shortcuts for assessing situations quickly. They are not meant to give one a comprehensive information about what's going on, but they give a general idea that something doesn't quite smell right.

After staring at burn down charts for years, i feel like i can tell the general dynamics in a team and their processes struggles after looking at a few last burn down charts. If the chart looks like a plateau, fire the tech lead; if it looks like a cliff fire the PO; if it looks like a triangle, leave the team alone and go do something else.

Obviously, I'm not going to fire anyone, and wouldn't really recommend anyone do that either, it's just my mental shortcut. That's how I think; I'm pretty rude on the inside, I guess. In this article, I just wanted to unpack that process and the reasoning behind it a bit.

## Why burn down charts?

To be honest, I think there is nothing inherently superior about burn down charts. All sorts of other tools could be used to quickly assess a team's health. If anything, if I hand to choose just one tool, I'd probably look at the frequency of deployment as the most reliable indicator.

Burn down charts are quite ubiquitous though. They are readily available, and they're visual. And it's easier to tell a story through visual cues.
