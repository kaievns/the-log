When I'm looking for engineering manager candidates among technical leads, the
way they work with other people is definitely the key. All of them are well
accomplished as technologists, and they picked up enough process knowledge by
this point to be dangerous. And, the way they relate to other people is what
determines to me whether they are ready for the next step or not.

And yet, even with the most talent for working with other people, the first time
engineering managers often struggle with the concept of managing people. I find
that many newly minted EMs don't get any coaching ot the matter either.

So, today I'm going to share some structures and tips. I hope it will be helpful
to some of you.

## The structure

There are always structures and ways of thinking about problems. We even have
the chaos theory that structures the utter chaos. Managing people is no
different, there is a method to the madness.

There are multiple ways to think about it, but one structure that I particularly
like works like so:

1. Define what the success looks like
2. Give feedback, or follow up

It sounds simple, but it's not. You'd be surprised how many managers, including
very senior level ones, never learn how to do this effectively. It takes
practice until this combo becomes natural, and there are few reasons for that.

Defining success in fair and consistent manner is surprisingly difficult. It's
even more difficult to describe it a succinctly clear and hard to misinterpret
format.

Ideally, your direct report should have this elevator pitch sized idea of what
the success looks like. Something that they can take away with them from your
meetings and latch onto in their minds. It will be exceptionally helpful for
them to know when and how you're going to be checking in with them on their
progress.

As a manager you should sit down and think through those two items every time
when a new person starts, and when a new project/initiative commences. You need
to have them on the ready, preferably written down, so you could refer to them
later.

## Goals vs. tasks

When it comes to defining what the success looks like, people tend to think
basically in two categories: goals and tasks. Some might even think they are the
same, but there is a key difference.

Task is a measure of utility. A person is expected to complete the task as
closely to the specification as possible. For example:

> Hey, you there! I want to hang a picture on the wall, so if it's not too much
> trouble, please drill me a hole right here where I'm pointing.

A goal is a different thing all together and in this case would sound something
like this:

> I have a picture that needs hanging. When you have a moment, would you mind
> hanging it somewhere where it's aesthetically pleasing? Thank you.

The key here is to remember that you are managing highly intelligent and
creative people. Giving them tasks is degrading to their intelligence. If they
wanted to move units, they'd work at a factory. They are not here to do your
bidding, they are here to problem solve. And, it is your job to give them
problems, not solutions.

You can set up career goals, project goals, business goals, etc. Just remember,
to set goals together with the people, collaboratively. Because goals that you
just hand down to people, are called tasks. In the end of the day you need the
people to own the goals.

The only person you should be giving tasks to is your boss. Tell you a secret
bosses love tasks, it makes them feel useful on the inside. But, the tradition
dictates that they are supposed to say "no" three times to your requests before
doing anything about it. So, use them sparingly

## Corrective feedback

When you defined your goals well this part is just plain hard. But, when you
defined your goals poorly, this part is doubly hard, but also awkward. Because
nobody wants to work for two weeks on something just to hear from their manager:
"hey, i didn't think it through well the last time, so I've changed my mind"

The purpose of feedback is to course correct. Which means that feedback needs to
be thought through and consistent. This is where the _collaborative_ goal
setting pays off. Because you will always have the leverage of: "I believe we
had agreed on bla, why am I seeing not bla?" in those conversations.

When people do what they're supposed to do, it's kinda easy. Probably my
favourite part of the job, actually. You just hand over some gold stars, and
move onto the next batch of fires.

When, on the other hand, things aren't going so smoothly, that is where you need
to be most diligent and consistent. Coincidently this is where the first time
engineering managers falter the most. Because giving corrective feedback is
uncomfortable. And, it's easy to feel attacked when you're on the other side of
it.

When we're facing a tense situation our fight or flight response kicks in, and
the natural way to think about the situation is that you have basically two
options: either let it slide, or challenge the other person. And that is how
monkeys sort things out. You, as a bit more evolved mammal, don't have to do
either of them.

There is a third option, it is called the _assertive_ mode of interaction. You
neither flee nor challenge. You offer your perspective, reiterate your
expectations, and then let the other person figure out how to respond. Most
likely they will respond with a flight or fight reaction, because you're their
manager. But, after a while, things will settle and you will get back to problem
solving in no time.

Giving corrective feedback is never easy, it is always uncomfortable, even when
you get better at it. The sooner you realise that this is part of the job and
move on the better. Also, same as with goals setting, thinking about feedback in
collaborative format, helps a lot.

Never boss people around, but also, never ever skip on corrective feedback
because _you are uncomfortable_ with the process. The people you manage deserve
you being clear and consistent with them. That is where you really earn your
standing with your people as a leader.
