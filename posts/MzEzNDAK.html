Still, after hiring so many engineers, I find that a lot of people are confused
about what a software engineering career actually looks like. Especially in the
early years, when all people want is to write code.</p>
<p>As I’m planning to write on the topic of engineering management in this feed, I
want to start with a post that goes through the roles of a software engineering
function. This isn’t meant as a comprehensive guide on the subject, more like a
map of the territory; something I can refer to later.</p>
<p>I also hope it will shed some light onto the topic of software engineering
career progressions for those who are at the beginning of their journey.</p>
<h2 id="a-note-on-regionalisms-and-titles"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#a-note-on-regionalisms-and-titles"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>A note on regionalisms and titles</h2>
<p>Anyone who spent enough time in software engineering knows that standards is a
bit of a running joke in the industry. Funnily enough the role definitions vary
from a company to a company, and from a region to a region as well.</p>
<p>I’ll try to stick to the principles and point out the differences that I know
of, but just a fair warning. If some roles mean a different thing in your
region, that’s fine. It doesn’t really mean a whole lot, it’s just naming. And
naming is hard.</p>
<p>Additionally, the situation is complicated by the fact that there is a
difference between roles and titles. Often times a title might carry several
roles — like at a startup for example. And sometimes titles are given for,
well, personal reasons, in which case the title might not actually enact the
role it implies.</p>
<h2 id="the-big-picture"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-big-picture"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The big picture</h2>
<p>When it comes to roles and careers, regardless of a function, there are normally
three categories of people that we need to keep in mind:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Individual contributors</strong> — those who do the actual work</li>
<li><strong>Middle management</strong> — those who manage the workers</li>
<li><strong>Senior management</strong> — those who manage the managers</li></ol>
<p>This is a recurring pattern in contemporary management practices and it’s
repeated throughout most organisations. Software engineering is not an
exception. All roles in engineering organisations fall into those three
categories rather distinctly.</p>
<p>Moreover, as one progresses in their career, a transition between those
categories usually comes with a seismic shift in ones responsibilities and ways
of work. All the knowledge and experience one gathered on the previous level
helps as a context, but normally gets pretty useless on the next level.</p>
<h2 id="the-actual-picture"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-actual-picture"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The actual picture</h2>
<p>With all the preambles out of the way, lets look at the actual picture in the
context of a software engineering team. Again, keep in mind that this is a
simplified version to convey the general structure. In real life it can shrink
or expand depending on the size and needs of an organisation. New titles can be
introduced, or several roles might go under the same title.</p>
<figure class="rehype-figure"><img src="/_app/immutable/assets/engineering-roles-0fc6d069.webp" alt="Engineering roles"><figcaption>Engineering roles</figcaption></figure>
<p>I have grouped all the straight up developer roles into one box, because from
the career perspective there is not much difference between them, you just get
more skilled and earn a bit more salary, and that’s pretty much it.</p>
<p>The <strong>tech lead</strong> role can be rather ambiguous for multiple reasons. Generally
speaking it sits between the technical and managerial career tracks — I’ll get
to that in a second. This is the first time a person is given responsibilities
over other people, and it might or might not be considered an IC role.</p>
<p>The <strong>principal engineer</strong> and <strong>engineering manager</strong> are considered to be part
of the middle management. One focuses on technology, and the other one on people
and processes. Sometimes you’d see <strong>staff engineer</strong> in this group as well.</p>
<p>The <strong>heads of</strong>, <strong>VPs</strong> and <strong>CTO</strong>, are part of the <em>senior leadership</em> team.
Sometimes you will see <strong>director of</strong> in those structures, they are normally
part of this team as well. But, the <strong>director</strong> and <strong>VP</strong> titles mean
different things in different regions, so I’m not using directors in the diagram
to make it less confusing.</p>
<h2 id="the-two-paths"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-two-paths"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The two paths</h2>
<p>As you have noticed, I’ve outlined two paths in my picture, the technical path
and the management path. They are not such a clean cut in real life. You
actually need a fairly large engineering team to have the split, and in a lot of
cases they’re glued together. But the distinction still exists and it’s not a
trivial one.</p>
<p>The problem here is that management is a discipline of its own, and a pretty
complicated one at that. Being great at both technology and management is a lot
to ask of a person. Even if they have the mental capacity to be great at either
one of them, doing two jobs means they won’t do either one well. It’s often
times hard to accept, especially for ex-technical people. But, unfortunately
that is how this game works.</p>
<p>And so you have two trenches, one focuses on technology: architecture, and best
practices; and the other focuses on management: people, processes, etc. They are
deeply intervened, but ultimately have different goals and responsibilities. So,
when you think about you career, you really need to think about what do you want
to do long term, build or manage.</p>
<h2 id="the-technical-path"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-technical-path"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The technical path</h2>
<p>It’s easy and natural to think of the technical path as the continuation of the
IC technical work. All those technical roles when split out of the management
path, rarely come with any actual direct reports, and seem like you’re getting
more and more technical.</p>
<p>In a way it is true, but it is also an illusion. There is an old saying in
management: “as you climb up, you loose control but gain influence”. The thing
is that great technical work at scale doesn’t happen by an accident. There is a
method to the madness. It looks somewhat like this:</p>
<pre class="language-undefined"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class="language-undefined">Vision -&gt; Strategy -&gt; Plan</code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>
<p>It might sound like a whole lot of nonsense, but it’s not. That’s a natural
process in almost every undertaking, and software engineering is not an
exception to that rule. The <strong>CTO</strong> is expected to formulate the vision, the
<strong>head of architecture</strong> is responsible for the technical strategy, and the
<strong>principal engineer</strong> is responsible for producing the change management plan.</p>
<p>It sounds a bit like a top down approach, but in reality, in a high functioning
organisation, it is a lot of back and fourth. Technical leadership is a team
sport, albeit it looks like a sport that introverts would enjoy.</p>
<p>Let me wrap this section by saying this. If you’re stepping on this path, don’t
expect writing a whole lot of code. Instead you will be dealing with regulatory
issues, schmoosing with vendors, writing lots of documentation, and occasionally
dealing with obnoxious know it all tech leads who you don’t even manage.
Otherwise it’s a lot of fun.</p>
<h2 id="the-managerial-path"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-managerial-path"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The managerial path</h2>
<p>You know what they say, you need all sorts of people to make a team work.
Unfortunately, when you get all sorts of people together in one room, all they
want is to murder each other; usually mostly figuratively. That’s where you need
the managers, and hence the manager’s track.</p>
<p>The management path often times called the executive track, and the reason for
that is a bit complicated but also simple. CTO is rarely expected to succeed as
CEO, even though they report to them. It’s the VP of engineering who has the
succession line to ascend as a CEO if needed. The reason being that CEO is an
executive, or a manager; and CTO is not, they are a strategist. VP of
engineering for all intents and purposes is an executive, they often don’t even
have a technical background and they usually report to the CEO in parallel with
a CTO, and can step up if necessary.</p>
<p>I hope, now you understand the path and the dynamics in the management path. On
one side you have a tech lead who don’t know much of anything about management,
on the other end you have a person who can run the entire organisation. That’s
the management track progression.</p>
<p>Engineering managers as a rule come from a technical background, but this rule
is a fast and loose one and there are plenty of exceptions; most notably people
migrating from product and operations. With heads of and VPs, there are no rules
really, and both are usually very rusty when it comes to programming.</p>
<p>To be frank, your technical chops, or how smart you are, matters very little on
this track. Your passion for people and processes, for driving the business what
matters here the most. A friend of mine, and an excellent EM (call me) often
jokes that his entire career is built upon a british accent and wearing glasses.
And there is an element of truth to that joke, trust is a hard currency in
management. And you’ll need to get your act together if you want to thrive on
this path.</p>
<p>I also think the management path has a way higher ceiling than the technical
path. Both in terms of career growth as well as the pay scale</p>
<h2 id="in-real-life"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#in-real-life"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>In real life</h2>
<p>In real life this structure can morph substantially. It is most notably affected
by the size of an organisation and by the talents and inclinations of people
occupying those roles. There are several notable examples of this:</p>
<p>Firstly, a startup. There is an old joke that a startup CTO is the most
underqualified person for the job. And there is certainly a lot of truth to that
joke. In a startup a CTO is a title, not really a role. Most startup CTOs
basically have the role of a <strong>tech lead</strong>, and the org structure looks like so:</p>
<pre class="language-undefined"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class="language-undefined">Developer -&gt; CTO</code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>
<p>Second example would be a growth company. Here yuu will see an actual management
layer, but the technical and the managerial tracks often glued together: EM dubs
as a principal engineer, HoE dubs as HoA, and the CTO dubs as a VP of
Engineering.</p>
<pre class="language-undefined"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class="language-undefined">Developers -&gt; EMs -&gt; Head of Engineering -&gt; CTO -&gt; CEO</code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>
<p>Lastly, a large corporate structure can be a bit strange as well. In this
instance you would have a very layered technical track that includes principal
engineers, solution architects, researchers, etc. And the managerial path would
have directors and VPs.</p>
<pre class="language-undefined"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class="language-undefined">Developers -&gt; EMs -&gt; Directors -&gt; Heads of E -&gt; VPs</code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>
<p>Again, note that in some regions and companies, directors and VPs have the
opposite meaning. Sometimes you would see a <strong>senior</strong> added to the titles. I
even saw a HoE reporting to a HoE examples, it’s all a big mess. A simpler way
to look at it is this. They basically have a two stages middle management and
two stages senior management structure.</p>
<p>The bigger the company is the harder it is to manage, and they usually end up
dividing themselves into independent sub-structures with multiple CTOs/VPs.</p>
<h2 id="final-notes"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#final-notes"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Final notes</h2>
<p>Well, I hope this added some value. I’m reluctant to use the word “clarity”
here, because org structures are exceptionally messy topic; especially when
politics and egos start to get involved. But, I hope I have managed to explain
the underlying principles a little bit.</p>
<p>There is a simpler way to look at this picture and that is called the “scope of
responsibilities”. All you need to do is to decide for yourself what is it you
want to be responsible for. Is that people, technology, processes, maybe all
three? That will dictate the roles you’re looking for, and types of
organisations you want to work for.</p>
<p>Generally speaking though, there is just one rule. If you want to grow your
career, make sure your scope of responsibilities keeps expanding. In the end of
the day that what defines <strong>seniority</strong>, how much complexity you can be trusted
to handle. And the only thing that matters in answering this question is your
past experience. So, always ask for more responsibilities and deliver.</p></div></article></main>
