    <div class="mt-8 prose prose-sm prose-cactus prose-headings:font-semibold prose-headings:before:absolute prose-headings:before:-ml-4 prose-headings:before:text-accent prose-headings:before:content-['#'] prose-th:before:content-none"><p>There is no shortage of talk about building a good culture in organisations
those days. But, if you have red my article about the
<a href="/posts/we0V4">inner workings of a culture</a> — yes, a shameless plug — you know
I have a rather divergent view on the subject.</p>
<p>And so, today I wanted to step away from generalisms and talk more specifics:
how to actually build a decent culture in a software engineering organisation.
And yes, it doesn’t have to involve buying a ping-pong table and hanging the
company values posters in the office.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-rules"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#what-are-the-rules"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>What are the rules</h2>
<p>As I mentioned in my previous article, I’m not a huge fan of values based
culture creation. Because it’s not specific enough for the actual goal we’re
trying to achieve; which is building a great engineering culture. And so,
instead, I will talk about it in terms of creating a good solid environment
conducive to creative work, such as software engineering.</p>
<p>My main problem with values driven environments is that they tend to mostly
contain and proliferate the founders values rather than the group’s needs and
wants. It’s great if the founders know what they’re doing and can set good norms
for their peers rather for their own comfort. But, more often than not, that’s
not the case and it’s “my way or the highway”, all the way to the IPO. Well, if
that ever happens.</p>
<p>Instead, I want to talk about the fundamentals. I want to talk about building a
great working environment with strong peers cohesion from scratch. How it works
and what’s important.</p>
<p>There are, most likely, more than one way to look at the problem, but there is a
framework that had stuck with me throughout the years. It defines the
prerequisites for a person’s safe and productive attachment to a peer group.
It’s formulated through the following three fundamental questions:</p>
<ol><li>Do I belong here?</li>
<li>Do we have a future together?</li>
<li>Am I safe?</li></ol>
<p>Now, lets unpack those a little bit</p>
<h2 id="culture-and-belongingness"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#culture-and-belongingness"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Culture and belongingness</h2>
<p>Belongingness is the foundation of any strongly cohesive group dynamic. It is
the sense of belongingness that generates the implicit trust that all high
performing teams require to operate successfully; especially if a decent amount
of stress and uncertainty involved.</p>
<p>Belongingness is a double edged tool though. The easiest way to cultivate a
sense of belongingness is to run an exclusive club. If all the members are
essentially the same, then the sense of belongingness comes by default. The
problem with exclusive clubs though is that they don’t scale and they don fare
well when they face change.</p>
<p>We don’t have to walk far to see examples of that. The history of open-source is
littered with the white middle-class dude communities. They all struggle to
expand beyond those circles even when they try really hard to be open and
inclusive. Because if an new member is not like the 90% of a homogeneous group,
they won’t feel like they belong there, no matter what the group leaders say.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the main point. We call this a <em>sense</em> of belonging
because it is intuitive and non-verbal. Words don’t really matter much here, and
a person needs to <em>feel</em> like they belong to a group, not to rationalise it.</p>
<p>The problem here is that belongingness grows out of one’s <em>identity</em>. If a
person can bring their whole self into a group and drop their barriers — and
hence become a productive member of this peer group — then they can say that
they belong there. If on the other hand, their identity is not acknowledged or
considered inferior the identities of the rest of the group, then this person is
bound to struggle regardless of anyone’s best efforts and intentions.</p>
<p>There is a way out of this mess, and it’s called <strong>diversity</strong>. An identity of a
group can be purposefully crafted around the idea of diversity as the unifying
factor. If a group is purposefully non-homogeneous, and differences are innately
valued, then it is bringing that unique self into the group that turns into the
bonding factor. Because, being different brings value to the group.</p>
<p>It is a surprisingly difficult feat to pull off, though. Basically because in
any diverse environment there is usually a dominant group that will <em>allow</em> for
the diversity to exist for as long as their own status at the top of the food
chain is not challenged.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the most difficult idea to stomach. If we want to build a
culture that scales and evolves long term, we need to build a culture around
diversity. And the only way to build a diversity based culture is to build a
diverse leadership team. And the only way to build a high functioning and
diverse leadership team is when the big boss is not a member of the dominant
group.</p>
<p>Look, I didn’t say it will be easy. Nothing worth doing is easy.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-that-binds-us"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-future-that-binds-us"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The future that binds us</h2>
<p>In my humble opinion, one of the most moronic blunders any leader can do is to
threaten firing people if they won’t do what they are told. Another one in the
same category would be going into redundancies and expect that those who remain
would feel grateful to still have a job. Here is another one, hire a whole lot
of contractors to get to the market faster.</p>
<p>What do you think all of those decisions have in common and why are they
detrimental to creating a good robust culture? It’s just one thing: those
decisions either threaten or don’t assume continuity in a relationship.</p>
<p>Continuity, or shared future, is another critical ingredient in any healthy
culture. Because if there is no future, or the future is highly uncertain, then
why bother? Why bother going extra mile, why bother being helpful or nice, why
even bother staying with the group? Time is universally in a limited supply for
everyone, and no-one in their right mind will invest their most precious assent
into something that has no future.</p>
<p>Even the most loyal to the company and its mission will mentally check out and
play it safe if their future with the company is threatened.</p>
<p>Employment is a source of income for most people, but it is also a source of
purpose. It is especially true for the most impactful creative professionals.
Because creative people seek creative experiences, that’s how they derive
meaning and value in their lives. And an act of creation is innately linked with
things to come, the future. Break that link and you break the reason for a
creative person to show up at work.</p>
<p>The opposite is also true. By creating a lofty goal, a leader can create a
narrative where the work people do is linked to a shared future. And that is why
“lets change the world for the better” slogans are so effective, even though
they are kind of a cringe. The goal doesn’t have to be saving the world though,
it could as well be as mundane as building a decent place to work.</p>
<p>If a sense of belongingness is a fundament for trust and formation of a robust
culture, then the shared future is the glue that keeps everyone together.</p>
<h2 id="safe-environment"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#safe-environment"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Safe environment</h2>
<p>There is an endless list of amazing articles about psychological safety at a
work place. So, I won’t beat around the bush and repeat what was said before.
But, I wanted to add a few points that relate to building a good culture at
work.</p>
<p>If belongingness and shared future are prerequisites for people to show up
excited about work, then their safety defines the limits of their involvement.
Because, generally, people will only go as far as the safety will allow them.</p>
<p>Creative work is always exploratory and uncertain. Every time an engineer takes
up a ticket and starts writing code they take risks. Risks that the thing won’t
pan out the way they imagined, risks that they will run into unexplored areas
and have no idea what to do, risks that their solution will explode weeks later.
And they will only take as much risks as their appetite for possible
repercussions will allow them.</p>
<p>Here is the problem though. The team’s leader/manager is the most privileged
person in the group. As the result, they won’t <em>feel</em> or <em>see</em> the risks the way
the people who actually do the work do. It is especially true in a
cross-functional environment where the leader can’t make innate value judgements
for half of the people on the team.</p>
<p>One smart person described it this way. Imagine you’re working at a nuclear
waste excavation and disposal site, and you don’t have a geiger counter.
Actually most of your team don’t have them, it’s just a few people who have
geiger counters. Just <em>believing</em> that everyone’s safe without listening to
those who can actually measure the environment is basically irresponsible.</p>
<p>Psychological safety issues in a team don’t start with the leadership or it’s
strongest members, they start by affecting the most vulnerable ones first.
Junior devs, minorities, people who are going through a rough patch in life.
Those are the people you have to <em>really listen to</em> if you are serious about
building psychological safety at work.</p>
<p>Ever heard of a canary in a mine? Every single team has one. Make sure you find
them and listen to them all the time.</p>
<h2 id="closing-remarks"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#closing-remarks"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>I’ll try to wrap it up in a rather controversial way. But, this is the best
analogy I have at the moment.</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed how similar religious organisations structures and
contemporary corporate environments are? When you look at a company after a
company, you’ll see that all of them have N tenets that employees supposed to
adopt as their own, and on top of that they have to demonstrate unconditional
trust into the clergy and their decisions.</p>
<p>Given how long religions tend to survive, it might be not the most terrible
idea. But, there is also a very dramatic history of suppressed innovation and
intolerance for divergent ideas. And so, if we’re trying to create a culture
that supports and <em>cultivates</em> disruptive innovation, then it follows that this
might be not the best system to emulate.</p>
<p>Where we might want to look instead is practices that creative undergrounds use,
because that is where innovation happens as a way of life. And if you look
closely, you will notice that most of those subcultures share similar traits:
diversity as a default setting, shared drive for building the better tomorrow,
and looking after the most vulnerable members of the community.</p>
<p>Do that in any form that works for you and you will be better off in terms of
building a productive engineering culture than 90% of those companies that hang
their “work harder” values posters on walls.</p>
<p>Well, at least that’s what I think.</p></div></article></main>
