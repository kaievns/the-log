There is
so much terminology in the leadership space that it’s pretty easy to conclude
that it’s all non-value producing BS and adopt a rather cynical mindset towards
management.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, whenever more than two people are involved in solving a problem,
leadership is a very much real thing. And so, today I’ll try to do my best to
unpack it and show how leadership works structurally.</p>
<h2 id="vision-strategy-plan"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#vision-strategy-plan"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Vision, strategy, plan</h2>
<p>Leadership can be a pretty murky business. It varies from an industry to an
industry significantly, and to make matters even worse, most software
engineering companies start essentially as snowflakes; as unique as their
complement of founders.</p>
<p>Fortunately for us, people have done a fair bit of thinking on the subject.
There are a lot of ways to look at the problem, but one of the common frameworks
divides what leaders do into three main categories.</p>
<pre class="language-undefined"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class="language-undefined">Vision -&gt; Strategy -&gt; Plan</code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>
<p>Which, coincidentally, are probably the most confusing three words on the
planet. So, let me unpack each of those in order.</p>
<h2 id="the-b-hag"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-b-hag"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The B-HAG</h2>
<p>Vision is easier explained through another term called <strong>BHAG</strong>. Which stands
for: “Big Hairy Audacious Goal”. I know, I know, explaining an unknown via
another unknown, just stay with me here for a second.</p>
<p>A good vision is not some ephemeral abstract pipe dream. “World domination” is
not a good vision. “Making a lot of money” is not a good vision either. That’s
why vision is better to be defined as a goal or a destination.</p>
<p>The great thing about thinking of a vision as a goal is that a goal needs to
have a clear definition of success. My goal right now for example is to write a
decent management article. I want to see two screens worth of text that make a
point and reads well. That’s my definition of success. And so, similarly,
“become the biggest player in space X” is a decent vision, and so is “Make
enough money to buy a house in Sydney”.</p>
<p>The vision also needs to be challenging, something you can’t just go and buy off
the shelf. “Make a good cup of coffee” is not a BHAG, “Create the best coffee
house within 30 minutes walking distance” is; well, at least to some people it
is.</p>
<p>And finally, a good vision needs to be hairy. “Getting a six-pack” is difficult,
but it’s not complicated, you just diet well and exercise, any average Joe with
enough time on their hands can do that. “Getting a six-pack while raising 3
children and managing a chronic back pain” on the other hand is complicated. We
want the vision to be hairy because complicated problems is what jells great
teams together.</p>
<p><strong>Big. Hairy. Audacious. Goal. B-HAG</strong> - that’s your vision</p>
<h2 id="what-is-strategy"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#what-is-strategy"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>What is strategy?</h2>
<p>In the most basic terms, a strategy is essentially a set of decision making
rules that help a team to move towards the vision. For example:</p>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>: Run an illegal cab company</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong>:</p>
<ul><li>We need a great PR system to toot our horn and paint the regulated cabs
industry as villains</li>
<li>We target the most vulnerable groups of people as drives so we could skip on
social benefits payouts and have great margins</li>
<li>We funnel profits into buying off as many politicians as we can, especially in
2nd world countries</li></ul>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>: Run a low coster flight company</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong>:</p>
<ul><li>Avoid major expensive air ports</li>
<li>Avoid air plane maintenance costs</li>
<li>Target the low income demographic who won’t complain about the quality of
service</li></ul>
<p>Apologies for a bit of poignant examples. Here is a better one:</p>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>: Run a happy software engineering company</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong>:</p>
<ul><li>Build useful stuff so that you could afford good engineers</li>
<li>Treat people decently and always invest in their development</li>
<li>Build an unquestionable EVP presence on the market</li>
<li>Don’t use technology for evil</li></ul>
<p>I hope this starts to make sense. A good strategy should be linked <em>directly</em> to
the <strong>vision</strong>, and, it should <em>not</em> have specific details. Because a strategy
is not a plan, a strategy is a decision making heuristic.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-not-a-strategy"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#what-is-not-a-strategy"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>What is <em>not</em> a strategy</h2>
<p>Before I jump into the <strong>plan</strong> part, I think it’s worth saying a few words
about what is often considered a strategy, but really is not.</p>
<p>Operational efficiency is not a strategy. All too often strategy decks contain
terms like “agile”, “reducing cycle time”, and such. All of those are great
things to have. But, for any business that aims to build something useful
operational efficiency should be a default setting.</p>
<p>The same goes for pretty much all other best practice items, such as:
reliability, treating customers well, etc., etc. Those are not business
differentiating items, everyone serious about their business does these.</p>
<p>Moreover items like those should flow directly out of a strategy. The reason
being is that it is very easy to get lost in best practices and start applying
them without moving any closer to the vision.</p>
<p>I know first hand how aggravating the term non-value adding activity can be when
applied to a best practice; we all have the best intentions. But, if it doesn’t
add value, it most likely burns resources that could be used for something else.</p>
<h2 id="so-whats-with-the-plan"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#so-whats-with-the-plan"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>So, what’s with the plan?</h2>
<p>A <strong>plan</strong> in this case means specific todo items based on the strategy that
contribute to the vision. You can think of it this way.</p>
<p>A vision is a destination, it lives in the future and doesn’t exist yet. And a
strategy is a set of rules to direct us towards that vision, it doesn’t have any
specifics in it by the definition. And so there is a void between the <strong>now</strong>
and the <strong>vision</strong>; a gap of uncertainty.</p>
<p>And so a plan is really a set of best guesses about what we can do <em>now</em> that
can move us one step closer to realising the vision. And as such, what goes into
the <strong>plan</strong> is roadmaps, hiring plans, budgets, skill and process gaps
improvements, and such and such.</p>
<p>All plans are essentially about putting one foot in front of the other. And it’s
critical to approach them this way. Because, while people on the team might buy
into the vision, they’ll loose interest in it very quickly if they don’t see a
<em>progress</em>. And in that light, iterative plans that demonstrate that progress on
regular basis are the best ones to have.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-structure-evolves"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#how-the-structure-evolves"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>How the structure evolves</h2>
<p>There is a certain structure how the leadership elements are connected together,
but it is a mistake to think that one irreversibly dictates the other.
Information flows from the bottom up too. And that puts the whole structure in a
flux, which is what we really want in the ever changing market conditions.
Different parts change at different paces though.</p>
<p>Vision doesn’t normally change a whole lot. It gets rather refined and better
defined as an organisation matures. But, sometimes the vision changes
dramatically, and that is what we call “a pivot”. Like Slack for example, it
started as a game development team but then pivoted to make, well, the slack
app.</p>
<p>One needs a strongly coherent and well bonded team to pull off a pivot though.
Because a pivot often comes with significant employee churn. Because people who
joined earlier might not necessarily subscribe to a new vision.</p>
<p>Strategy is also a rather slow moving target. But, unlike vision which requires
some dramatic impact to be changed, a strategy is normally goes through regular
revisions; usually in the form of annual strategy reviews. A strategy depends as
much on a vision as on the market conditions and the complexities of the
organisation itself. As both of those change the strategy needs regular
adjustments.</p>
<p>Plans is the fastest moving part of a leadership structure. As such, plans
always need to be seen as temporary. All plans are only as as good as the
underlying assumptions about the market. As an organisation interacts with the
market, both of them change, and plans should be mercilessly changed along with
that.</p>
<h2 id="all-together"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#all-together"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>All together</h2>
<p>Traditionally, on the organisation level, the structure would work like so:</p>
<ol><li>The company board defines the <strong>vision</strong></li>
<li>The senior leadership team comes up with a <strong>strategy</strong> to support it</li>
<li>Middle-management creates and executes <strong>plans</strong> based on the vision and the</li></ol>
<p>But, the interesting thing is that leadership has a fractal nature. The
structure and the principles repeat themselves on the smaller scopes over and
over again. The product level, the project level, even the team and individual
level.</p>
<p>Here is an example how a tech-lead could apply the same structure to lead their
team of engineers.</p>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>: We want to run a high-performing team that enjoys what it does</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong>:</p>
<ul><li>Create great working conditions</li>
<li>Build stuff that matters</li>
<li>People and relationships are important</li></ul>
<p><strong>Plan</strong>:</p>
<ul><li>Elevate quality of work to avoid surprises and all-outs</li>
<li>Manage people’s energy levels through realistic commitments</li>
<li>Practice enablement and sharing of responsibilities</li>
<li>Spend quality time together as a team</li></ul>
<p>As you can see, it is exactly the same structure. As a team leader you create a
shared <strong>vision</strong> for the team. Then together with the team you create a set of
rules (a <strong>strategy</strong>). And then based on those you iterate on <strong>plans</strong> to get
there.</p>
<p>We can apply this structure not just to lead down, but also to lead up. For
example:</p>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>: Great working relationships with my boss</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong>:</p>
<ul><li>Always be clear about what do they actually want from you</li>
<li>Transparent information flow both ways is critical</li>
<li>Cultivating a personal relationship is important</li></ul>
<p><strong>Plan</strong>:</p>
<ul><li>Always ask clarifying questions, even when you think you understood everything</li>
<li>Make sure there is an implicit and mutual agreement on your commitments</li>
<li>Be diligent with paperwork and reporting, never BS your boss</li>
<li>Never back down from what you need; keep asking until you get it</li>
<li>Don’t forget to ask about their day, family, and struggles regularly</li>
<li>Always deliver on your commitments</li></ul>
<h2 id="wrapping-up"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#wrapping-up"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>I don’t know what else to add here. I hope the idea makes sense now, and you can
apply it to your own circumstances. Always keep in mind the structure:</p>
