patterns of interconnection between engineering and other functions. Bulk of the
companies still treat engineering as a cost centre; an internal agency of sort.
But, the industry is getting smarter, in many companies engineering gets
integrated into cross-functional profit centers through autonomy and enablement
practices.</p>
<p>But, I believe that the role of technology in a software development
organisation goes further than mere cost vs. profit centre conversation. In the
most disruptive organisations technology itself is elevated to the state of
fundamental truth. That is how you build google maps, iphone, oculus rift, and
ChatGPT.</p>
<p>I have this little metaphor that I like to tell to demonstrate the point.</p>
<h2 id="the-beach"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-beach"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The beach</h2>
<p>Imagine a person walking a dog down a beach. The white noise of surf, a gentle
breeze. The dog is snooping back and fourth across the curved lip of the sand.
The person is lost a bit in their thoughts as they are trotting along.</p>
<p>The dog is making semi-random moves across the beach, and the person is slowly
following it. If you look at their foot prints along the beach, it looks like a
set of real-life data sampling smoothed with an exponentially moving average.</p>
<p>You can think of this image as a miniature representation of a software
engineering company.</p>
<p>The hound is the marketing and sales department. They interact with the market
non stop. There are tonnes of interesting and exciting things happening in the
market all the time. New customers, new competitors, new opportunities. And they
love chasing them all!</p>
<p>The person represents the product team. A person is dragged along by the dog.
But the person doesn’t repeat the dog’s footsteps exactly. A person analyses
what the dog finds and tries to makes sense out it. They enjoy each other
company, but, it is the person who holds the leash and decides where they’re
going.</p>
<p>The beach represents the engineering, or rather the technology itself. In the
end of the day, this little story—a person walks out a dog at the beach—the
path they take is defined by the curved shape of the beach. That is the
<em>context</em> of this story; it defines what’s possible.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-possible"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#what-is-possible"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>What is possible</h2>
<p>In the age when SaaS products are literally designed for fast migration off
competition, customer loyalty is a feeble thing. Building products with off the
shelf parts and then pray that you won’t have copycats with better margins is
just not a very smart idea. The product offering differentiation must go through
and through, including the technology. And the edge needs to be carefully
maintained over time.</p>
<p>Even in the b2b context where a vendor migration is a long and painful process,
those multi-year contracts are normally signed with the expectation that a
vendor will maintain their superiority long term.</p>
<p>And in that context, the most sustainable strategical foundation of any software
engineering company is to innovate relentlessly ahead of the competition. It’s a
classical red queen problem, a successful company has to innovate non-stop and
as fast as it can just to stay where they are.</p>
<p>Systems thinking postulates that any complex system’s behaviour is a result of
it’s internal structure. The beach, the person, and the dog is the internal
structure of most modern agile software development organisations; they all play
in roughly the same field in that aspect. And, it is this internal structure
that produces the behaviour we see, and, ultimately, separates successful
companies from those that perish way too soon.</p>
<h2 id="the-agile-way"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-agile-way"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The agile way</h2>
<p>When I think of <em>the beach</em> I see a technology possibilities space with an
overlay of customer adoption data. There is a lot that can be built with
technology, but not all of it will spark the customer’s interest.</p>
<p>In this sense, the contemporary iterative agile practices is a way to search
this space for something useful. Like the dog on the beach that is following the
smells, we follow the customer feedback. We’re trying to find where the
customer’s interest is clustered, and then build technology around that space.</p>
<p>And so, we follow the scent, and then we build around the hotspots. In a way we
give the customer what they want. But, however sensible this sounds, there is a
fallacy in this thinking. Because what the customer wants and what customer
needs, is usually not the same thing.</p>
<p>The way of agile can be summarised like so:</p>
<blockquote><p>Always listen the customer’s problems. Never listen to the customer’s
solutions</p></blockquote>
<p>In this technical possibilities space, the most disruptive solutions are not
located in the same spot where the customer wants are. When apple introduced
iPhone people didn’t want an iphone, they wanted <em>a</em> better phone. When google
introduced Gmail people didn’t want gmail, they wanted <em>a</em> better web-mail. When
microsoft introduced LLMs, people didn’t want LLMs, they wanted <em>a</em> better AIs.</p>
<h2 id="the-algorithm"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-algorithm"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The algorithm</h2>
<p>The closest concept to agile practices in computer science that I can think of
is genetic algorithms. GAs is a search heuristic to explore multi-dimensional
possibilities spaces that works on iterative mechanics. In general terms it
works like so:</p>
<pre class="language-undefined"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class="language-undefined">idea = initial_idea()

while solution_is_getting_better():
   options = generate_options_from(idea)
   idea = find_best_among_new(options)</code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>
<p>Essentially, it is an iterative search process. At every step we explore
possible steps forward, pick the best option and keep on moving. The actual real
life implementation of this process can be rather complex, but the idea is quite
simple and elegant; just like the process of evolution in the nature.</p>
<p>This type of search algorithms has one massive flaw, though. They all have a
tendency to get stuck in local maximums. Just like a team blindly following
customer’s feedback, those algorithms find something that works, but never can
punch through the negative space surrounding it to ever find the true maximum.</p>
<figure class="rehype-figure"><img src="/_app/immutable/assets/local-maximum-1dd3b231.webp" alt="Local maximum"><figcaption>Local maximum</figcaption></figure>
<p>There is a long list of ways computer science is trying to deal with this issue.
But, they all basically boil down to the same point: they introduce some ways to
explore other options than a straight up gradient descent. Usually it manifests
in random leaps outside of the normal exploration path.</p>
<h2 id="final-notes"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#final-notes"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Final notes</h2>
<p>We can endlessly jump between abstractions and their real life manifestations
like this. And, we will see exactly the same pattern emerge. In complex systems
facing limited computational resources, methodical search is rarely the optimal
approach.</p>
<p>The idea is rather counter intuitive, that in order to be effective in a random
complex environment, we need to introduce <em>more randomness</em> in our process and
explore options outside of the normal search path. But, I think Steve Jobs gave
it a good point of view.</p>
<blockquote><p>The customer doesn’t know what they want</p>
<cite>-- Steve Jobs</cite></blockquote>
<p>The thing we all keep forgetting at times is that in this industry, we’re not as
much bringing technology to the customers, as we bring the customers to
technology. The idea that we iterate to find out what the customer wants is an
illusion. In practice, we do the opposite of that, we iterate on <em>an idea</em> in
hopes that it will <em>attract</em> the customer.</p>
<p>And those initial ideas come from the technological possibilities space; from
finding out what’s possible. <em>The beach</em>, the technology itself is the
fundamental truth in this story.</p>
<p>So, don’t just blindly follow the dog, explore the beach too.</p></div></article></main>
